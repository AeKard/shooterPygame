I want to create random gen!

in what way? 

using array or tile_map = [1,0]
1 wall
0 emptyspace

each on has a size of 10 so its scalable to any 10th number "I think 10th?"
x = 2000, y = 1500 is always the size of the playable area 200, and 150 is the size of walls needed to fill the area
-> -> -> scaled to 200, 150 each tile
 1, 1, 1

I can do random gen by setting up condition for the walls and empty spaces and use random walk algo to carve a path

"For now"
- For each tile in the grid:
    - If the tile is on the edge (first or last row/column), set it to 1 (wall)
    - Else, set it to 0 (empty)

for y in range(rows):
    row = []
    for x in range(columns):
        if x == 0 or x == columns - 1 or y == 0 or y == rows - 1:
            row.append(1)  # Outer border wall
        else:
            row.append(0)  # Empty space
    tile_map.append(row)
